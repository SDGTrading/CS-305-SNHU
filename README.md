Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  The client was Artemis Financial, a financial institution looking to improve the security of their current application.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  Secure code is important to protect the information and data of clients and the company itself. Secure code increases a company's longevity and can improve reputation amongst customers.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  I found the dependency check tool to be helpful. I was unaware of this tool before this course and can see myself making use of it in future projects.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I found that updating dependencies and plugins helped to improve security. In the future periodic/scheduled dependency checks will be beneficial.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  I ensured the code was functional and secure through the use of constant debugging. I have found testing early and often to be a beneficial habit.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  For these assignments I posted on StackOverflow a couple times to get assistance when stuck. The community there is helpful and full of knowledge.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  Knowledge of hash functions.
